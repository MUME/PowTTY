Comfy Chairs
As you step down from the garden above, you find yourself in this comfortable
sitting room. The walls are adorned with murals chronicling the great race wars
of Arda. They tell the tale of one white-haired cleric weilding a bejewelled
oak staff and driving Sauron's forces back into their dark lairs. A few lap
blankets are casually laid around the room.
